# Data Scraping on the Web

## Implementing a web data collection pipeline with Python.
This project was developed during my training in Data Scientist in the undergraduate/bachelor's degree program in Data Science at the Virtual University of the State of SÃ£o Paulo and aims to build a data collection pipeline on the web using the Python programming language.

* **Note**: Project developed in 2021, however has been updated for versioning.
## **Caution**!
This project is a small demonstration of data collection on the web for research and/or educational purposes.

#
The Web stores vast amounts of data useful for research. It is an important source of data that is largely responsible for advancing data science and artificial intelligence. Scraping consists of an application capable of requesting a web server, requesting data, analyzing and extracting the necessary information. Web scraping activity is usually an alternative when there are no other ways (e.g. an API) to mine data needed by a project. However, in most cases it is also the practice of speeding up a process that was previously done manually. On the other hand, often public databases are not available to be consumed, however the information is available through access to Web pages and Scraping works very well for this type of proposal.
* ## **Warning**
When practicing Web Scraping always remember to observe data protection laws, as not all data that is public can be consumed and used.
